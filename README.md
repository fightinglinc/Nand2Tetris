### Developing a Hack Assembler
Develop an assembler that translates Hack assembly programs into executable Hack binary code
- Parser: unpacks each instruction into its underlying fields
- Code: translates each field into its corresponding binary value
- SymbolTable: manages the symbol table
- HackAssembler: initializes I/O files and drives the process.
